# The Reading Room — Community Library Lending Tracker

This is the starter repository for the **Java Basics** applied lab. Read the lab
brief alongside this repository; it explains the business, what you are being
asked to deliver, and how your work is assessed.

## What this is

A small program The Reading Room uses to track what is borrowed. It works, but it has become risky to change. Your task is to diagnose it
and rebuild it well — **not** to change what it does, but to make it safe to
change and impossible to leave in an invalid state.

## Running it

The program is plain Java (no external dependencies). You need JDK 21.

**With Maven:**

```bash
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=LendingTracker
```

**Or directly with the JDK:**

```bash
javac -d target/classes src/main/java/LendingTracker.java
java -cp target/classes LendingTracker
```

Run it first, before you change anything, so you can see how it currently
behaves. Look carefully at the end-of-day report.

## What to hand in

See the lab brief for the full list: a written diagnosis, your rebuilt version
(behaving exactly as the original does today), a short note on your key design
decisions, and one improvement beyond the brief. You will talk through your work
in a live review.
